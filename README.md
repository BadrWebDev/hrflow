## 🔌 API Endpoints

### Authentication
```http
POST   /api/register          # Create new account
POST   /api/login             # User login
POST   /api/logout            # User logout
GET    /api/me                # Get current user
```

### Leaves (Authenticated)
```http
GET    /api/leaves            # List leaves (all for admin, own for employee)
POST   /api/leaves            # Create leave request
GET    /api/leaves/{id}       # View specific leave
PUT    /api/leaves/{id}       # Update leave status (admin only)
DELETE /api/leaves/{id}       # Cancel leave request
```

### Notifications (Authenticated)
```http
GET    /api/notifications              # Get all notifications
GET    /api/notifications/unread-count # Get unread count
POST   /api/notifications/{id}/read    # Mark notification as read
POST   /api/notifications/mark-all-read # Mark all as read
```

### Admin Only Routes
```http
GET    /api/users             # List all employees
POST   /api/users             # Create employee
DELETE /api/users/{id}        # Delete employee

GET    /api/departments       # List departments
POST   /api/departments       # Create department
PUT    /api/departments/{id}  # Update department
DELETE /api/departments/{id}  # Delete department

GET    /api/leave-types       # List leave types
POST   /api/leave-types       # Create leave type
PUT    /api/leave-types/{id}  # Update leave type
DELETE /api/leave-types/{id}  # Delete leave type
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test API Endpoints
```bash
# Login and get token
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@hrflow.test","password":"Admin1234"}'

# Use token for authenticated requests
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/leaves \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

---

## 🎯 Key Features Implementation

### 1. Authentication Flow
- User logs in → Backend validates → Returns JWT token
- Token stored in localStorage
- Axios interceptor adds token to all requests
- Auto-redirect on 401 Unauthorized

### 2. Role-Based Access Control
```php
// Middleware protects admin routes
Route::middleware(['auth:sanctum', 'admin'])->group(function () {
    Route::post('/departments', [DepartmentController::class, 'store']);
});
```

### 3. Notification System
- **In-App Notifications:** Real-time bell icon with unread count
- **Email Notifications:** Beautiful HTML emails sent automatically
- **Triggers:** Leave submitted, approved, rejected, cancelled
- **Smart Routing:** Admins notified on submissions, employees on status changes

### 4. Real-Time Updates
- Optimistic UI updates
- Instant feedback on actions
- Auto-refresh after mutations

### 5. Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly interface
- Adaptive grid layouts
- Touch-optimized controls
